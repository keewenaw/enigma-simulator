An emulator of the WWII Enigma crypto machine, written in Java.

This was my capstone project for undergrad. I worked as part of a 4-man team to recreate the 
WWII Enigma cipher machine. My part involved recreating the internal rotors, ensuring they operated
in the same way as the original tangible machine.
