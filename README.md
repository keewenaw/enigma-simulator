# enigma-simulator
An emulator of the WWII Enigma crypto machine, written in Java.

Here's the functional JAR file: https://www.dropbox.com/s/8fa8fwx5419oylh/Enigma_Simulator.jar?dl=0

This was my capstone project for undergrad. I worked as part of a 4-man team to recreate the 
WWII Enigma cipher machine. My part involved recreating the internal rotors, ensuring they operated
in the same way as the original tangible machine.
